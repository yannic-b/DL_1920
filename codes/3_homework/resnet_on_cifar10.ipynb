    "\n",
    "Residual neural networks mainly consist of components called Residual Blocks. One residual block can be expressed as **y** = *F*(**x**) + **x** where **x** and **y** are the input and output of the block, respectively. So the input **x** is added to the result of *F*(**x**) using a *skip connection*. In this exercise, *F* consists of:\n",
    "* a convolutional layer with `in_channels` input channels, `hidden_channels` output channels, a kernel size of (3, 3), a stride of 1, padding of 1 and no bias parameter.\n",
    "* a batch normalisation layer \n",
    "* ReLU activation\n",
    "* a convolutional layer with `hidden_channels` input channels, `out_channels` output channels, a kernel size of (3, 3), a stride of 1, padding of 1 and no bias parameter.\n",
    "* a batch normalisation layer\n",
    "\n",
    "After this the `skip_connection` is applied. If the dimensions of *F*(**x**) and **x** don't match an extra linear projection is applied to **x** so the dimensions do match. This has already been implemented for you. You only need to call it at the right place. \n",
    "Finally, a ReLU activation is applied on the output **y**\n"
